# movie-picker

 Stores a to-do list of movies that you want to and have already watched.

 This vital, relationship-saving software also includes a random movie selector to cut down on the amount of time discussing what movie you should watch tonight.

## Configuration and Deployment
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
* use corresponding `.env.[mode]` file to configure. `.env*.local` files will be ignored by git
    - do not put secrets in env variables -- they are embedded into the build and thus can be inspected and found
    - env variables must start with `VUE_APP_`
    - [more about env and staging](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#example-staging-mode)

## App Design

### Movies
A list of all movies in the collection. Filterable by:
* watched
* rating
* genre

### Movie entity
* movie data -- pulled from MovieDB api
* watched flag
* rating
* genre

### User operations
* search for movies using api database
* add movies to collection
* add rating to a movie in the collection
* set watched flag for movies in collection
* set favorite flag for movies in collection
* get a random unwatched movie

### Work Flow:
* default: display all in own collection
* click Favorites to filter favorites
* click To Do to filter unwatched
* running a search:
    * show modal/table with results
        - click/hover shows details
    * batch edits to the search results:
        - checking an item to add it to the collection displays favorite/watched/rating inputs. user can then select: favorite, watched, rate
        - or: interacting with any of the action inputs auto adds the item, item can be manually added too
        - clicking modal "Save" adds all selected items to the collection

### TO DO
* maybe template MediaTable rows better (template rows not columns so you can add the type w/out being weird)
* OR add a Type prop to Media object -- i kinda like this better
    - go through and rejigger everything that evaluates type (instanceof / typeof)
* search:
    - search field clears after search but displays history (local mem cache)
    - add actions: details, add to collection
        * clicking a title opens details with an "Add to Collection" option
        * add fields to rate, set fave/watched and button to add
    - batch edits? ability to go through and star/check watched/rate and then click "save to collection"?
    - maybe replace simple table with datatable -- add no-results state
    - more finesse in the search field
* what does prod deployment for the app look like?
* refine our error state(s)
* update mock data in data.json
* test mock environment
* how to map okta user to our user model?
    - email might be the best "pk"...
* CSS overhaul: consolidate css for movies and search

### Feature List:
* add some kind of hot queue feature (stuff you want to watch soon)
    - change the favorite property to queue?
    - cos that might be redundant with 5 starts...
* add csv import/export option
* custom column sets
* add tags/categories/lists
* implement Surprise!
    - spinning pizza!
* add filter by genre
* add comments
* add [uNoGS](https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs) to query whether or not a movie is available on netflix
    - or try [Watch Here](https://rapidapi.com/devroldy/api/watch-here/details) -- get all the streaming things at once! -- would have to pay for this one
* add [bechdel test api integration](https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc)
* wow yr build takes one million years... see if you can delete some unused packages or something
