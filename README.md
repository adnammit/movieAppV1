# movie-picker

 Stores a to-do list of movies that you want to and have already watched.

 This vital, relationship-saving software also includes a random movie selector to cut down on the amount of time discussing what movie you should watch tonight.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run serve

### Compiles and minifies for production
npm run build

### Lints and fixes files
npm run lint

### Run your unit tests
npm run test:unit

```

## Configuration and Deployment
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
* use corresponding `.env.[mode]` file to configure. `.env*.local` files will be ignored by git
    - do not put secrets in env variables -- they are embedded into the build and thus can be inspected and found
    - env variables must start with `VUE_APP_`
    - [more about env and staging](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#example-staging-mode)
* deploy
```shell
    npm run build # minify for production
    ### fill out next steps
```

## App Design

### Movies
A list of all movies in the collection. Filterable by:
* watched
* rating
* genre

### Movie entity
* movie data -- pulled from google api?
* watched flag
* rating
* category -- user assigned or pulled from data?

### User operations
* search for movies using api database
* add movies to collection
* add rating to a movie in the collection
* set watched flag for movies in collection
* set favorite flag for movies in collection
* get a random unwatched movie
    - include optional filters by genre (random watched as well?)

### Work Flow:
* default: display all in own collection
* click Favorites to filter favorites
* click To Do to filter unwatched
* running a search:
    * show modal/table with results
        - click/hover shows details
    * batch edits to the search results:
        - checking an item to add it to the collection displays favorite/watched/rating inputs. user can then select: favorite, watched, rate
        - or: interacting with any of the action inputs auto adds the item, item can be manually added too
        - clicking modal "Save" adds all selected items to the collection


## TO DO
* create separate component for genres to use in both collection and search results view
* create rating component
* search:
    - add actions: details, add to collection
        * clicking a title opens details with an "Add to Collection" option
        * add fields to rate, set fave/watched and button to add
    - batch edits? ability to go through and star/check watched/rate and then click "save to collection"?
    - maybe replace simple table with datatable -- add no-results state
    - more finesse in the search field
* what does prod deployment for the app look like?
* refine our error state(s)
* movie ux
    - add filter by genre
* update mock data in data.json
* test mock environment
* how to map okta user to our user model?
    - email might be the best "pk"...
* CSS overhaul: consolidate css for movies and search
* support tv in collection
* add [uNoGS](https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs) to query whether or not a movie is available on netflix
* add [bechdel test api integration](https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc)
* nice stuff
    - do something with posters?
    - for a row, if click (hover?), display modal w/ poster and plot
    - add bechdel test search
* wow yr build takes one million years... see if you can delete some unused packages or something

## DONE
* refactor to use a centralized request mgr for cleaner code -- let components just be components
* re-write to use vuetify instead of bootstrap
* nice stuff
    - how to represent genres? icons?
        horror - ghost
        scifi - death-star-variant
        action - car-sports, gun, run-fast
        comedy - emoticon-lol, emoticon-lol-outline
        drama - drama
        romance - heart-multiple
        animation - draw
        western - cowboy, cactus
        documentary - video-vintage
    - allow sort by name, year, rating, watched, favorited
* typescript yo -- do some processing on movies
    - go through script and make sure you don't have dupe functions
* mocking data for development and for demo:
    - app will use `IMovieService` (and `IUserService` etc)
    - depending on environment, load either `MockMovieService` which returns static results or `MovieService` which actually talks to the backend
* your ids are all swizzled
    - you've got your id, imdbid and movieDbId
    - in your db/api, change imdbid -> movieDbId and store imdb too
* add a store
    - replace movies w/ results when searching
    - pass around isLoading/isErrored maybe
    - toggle favorites/unwatched views
* how much do we want to rely on imdb? should we store anything other than imdb id?
    - more robust to store the info (title, genre, year, etc) but not necessary
    - if we store it (or don't), we can write a script to get data from imdb and update values in db
* simplify error/loading state -- have appModule do it all, or does filter need it?
